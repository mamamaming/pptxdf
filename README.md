# PPTXdf: Free Browser-Based PDF to PPTX Converter

## What this Web App Is
PPTXdf is a fast, completely private, browser-based web application that converts your PDF documents into editable PowerPoint (PPTX) presentations.

## The Problem It Solves (and Who It's For)
Online document converters often require you to upload your sensitive files to their servers, raising significant privacy and security concerns. Additionally, server-based processing can be slow, especially for large files. 

**This app is for anyone**—students, professionals, educators, and businesses—who needs to quickly convert PDFs to PowerPoint presentations without compromising their privacy. By processing the files entirely within your web browser, PPTXdf ensures that your documents never leave your device.

## How to Use It
Using PPTXdf is incredibly simple:
1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Drag and drop your PDF file into the designated area (or click to browse and select a file).
3. Wait a few moments while the app processes the conversion locally.
4. Click the download button to save your new PPTX file to your computer.

## Cost
**This tool is 100% free.** There are no hidden fees, no subscriptions, and no paywalls.

## Why I Built This
This application is part of my ongoing project of building cool things to solve real problems. I believe in creating useful, accessible, and privacy-respecting tools that make people's lives easier!
