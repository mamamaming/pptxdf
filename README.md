# PPTXdf: Free Browser-Based PDF to PPTX Converter

## What this Web App Is
PPTXdf is a fast, completely private, browser-based web application that converts your PDF documents into PowerPoint (PPTX) presentations with no broken layouts and shifted fonts.

## The Problem It Solves (and Who It's For)
People use Canva to create presentations, but exporting Canva to PPTX often results in broken layouts and shifted fonts. What they have to do was export slides as PNG and place them in PowerPoint manually. This application replace that boring and time consuming work with just 3 clicks. 

**This app is for anyone**—students, professionals, educators, and businesses—who needs to quickly convert PDFs to PowerPoint presentations.

## How to Use It
Using PPTXdf is incredibly simple:
1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Drag and drop your PDF file into the designated area (or click to browse and select a file).
3. Wait a few moments while the app processes the conversion locally.
4. Click the download button to save your new PPTX file to your computer.

## Cost
**This tool is 100% free.** There are no hidden fees, no subscriptions, and no paywalls.
